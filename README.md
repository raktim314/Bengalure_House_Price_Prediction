Bangalore Apartments Price Prediction
============================

## Problem Statement

Buying a home, especially in a city like Bengalore, is a tricky choice. While the major factors are same for all major big cities, there are others to be considered for the Silicon Valley of India. With its help millennial crowd, vibrant culture, great climate and a slew of job opportunities, it is difficult to ascertain the price of a house in Bengaluru.

Now with the lingering impact of demonetization, the enforcement of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), and the lack of trust in property developers in the city, housing units sold across India in 2017 dropped by 7 percent. In fact, the property prices in Bengaluru fell by almost 5 percent in the second half of 2017, said a study published by property consultancy Knight Frank.


What are the things that a potential home buyer considers before purchasing a house? The location, the size of the property, vicinity to offices, school, parks, restaurants, hospitals or the stereotypical white picket fence? What about the most important factor - the price?

In this circumstances,  this project aims to build a model to predict the price of houses in Bengaluru.
